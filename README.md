## What Can Stash Explorer Do?

- üìÅ **Browse Your Stash:** Enhance your Stashapp browsing experience with extra functionality on top.
- üîç **Location Settings:** Modify where Stash Explorer pulls your Stashapp from. The default is http://localhost:9999/.
- üìù **System Tray Menu:** Get to your Stashapp content from anywhere on your computer, even if you're running another application. Minimise the program to the System Tray to keep it out of your way.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Start-up Settings:** Set Stash Explorer to start at a specific location (performer, gallery or tag) if you know the number corresponding to the place you want to go.
- ‚≠ê **Favourites:** (Coming Soon) Pin your favourite performers to the top so you can easily get to them at a later date, even when you're not on the performers page.
- üíº **Portability:** Run the program on any computer with its small footprint.
